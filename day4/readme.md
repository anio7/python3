Day3 talks about randomization. Module creation and list

To create your own modules you first need to create a new python file then save it and import it into the current file your're using.
To use the random module we first have to import it. Using the random.randint(a,b) which needs 2 integers. We learnt about random.choice()
which randomly chooses any element in a sequence.


We also learn about list creation and indexing through a list using listName[index]
