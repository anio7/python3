Day3 contains Conditional Statements,Code Blocks, Logical Operators and Scope(local and global)

The first conditional statement you will meet is if-else. It's syntax is-
if(condition):
#do something
else:
#do something
Anything that is indented after the if statement lives in the Code Block.

this conditional statement is if-elif-else and is used for multiple conditions
if(condition):
#do something
elif:
#do something
else:
#do something

Nested if/else Conditionals
if(condition): #this condition must be true for nested condition to work
if (another condition):
#do this
else:
#do this
else:
#do this


Then there are Comparison Operators

1. (<) greater than
2. (>)Less than
3. (==)equal to
4. (<=)greater than or equal to
5. (>=)less than or equal to

Logical Operators are :

1. (&&) And
2. (!) Not
3. (!=) Not Equal
