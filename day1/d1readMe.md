Day 1 teaches you about writing basic code in python using the print statement.

eg. print("Hello World!")

Commenting using the hash tag# symbol for singleline comments and triple quotes for multiline.
eg(""" 
    this 
    is
    multi-
     line
""" )

Debugging in the terminal shows you the line where the error occurred.

String Manipulation using backslash \n for newline \t for tab. Strings can even be added to one another by concatenation using (+) plus sign.
