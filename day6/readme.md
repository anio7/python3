Day6 is about learning code blocks, functions and while loops:

To create a function we use the keyword def then the function name. The code under the function must be indented.
def var():
do something.

Therefore you can say a function is a group of code that can be reused.
To trigger / call or invoke a function you type the function_name followed by parentheses and arguments if needed.

You can also loop a function if you have to repeat it a couple of times.
def var():
for i in range(0,varNum):
    var()

Using while loops work when the condition remains true - the condition is always written before the while loop.

#condition
while something_is_true:
do something
